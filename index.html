      <p>This two-day workshop will provide an introduction to R for fisheries biologists and technicians in the Wisconsin DNR.  R concepts and methods will be introduced through the use of data from the Fisheries Management Database.  The focus of this course, however, will be on developing foundational skills in R that can be transferred to other situations.  Participants will test application of their knowledge with hands-on exercises using their own data extracted from the FM Database.
Pre-Course Preparation</p>

<p>Perform the following tasks before the workshop.</p>

<pre><code>Install R and RStudio — Complete with the help of the State IT consultants.
Preparing R and RStudio — The directions in this link will make sure that your R and RStudio can use all special purpose programs required for the workshop.
Getting Started with RStudio — Review the material in this link to get a feel for the primary software used in the workshop.
Create a Workshop Folder — Create a folder on your computer that will contain all materials from the workshop (for those described in the next two bullets and created at the workshop).
Download Materials — Download (put in the folder created above) all scripts below and the data files for the “Introduction to Linear Models” on the second day.
Get FM Data — Instructions for pulling data from the FM database for your county were sent to you in an e-mail (on 21-Feb) and are in the central FH_PROJECTS location (\\central\Water\FH_PROJECTS\SV_ContinuingEducation\R Workshop).  If you do not have data in the FM database, then you can use a pull from Sawyer County that is in the same location on the WiDNR network.

<p>Please contact me with any questions.  If you wish to install R and RStudio on a personal (non-state) computer, then let me know and I can provide you with directions.
